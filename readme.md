# Portfolio site shell

A basic shell of a portfolio site with a landing view, about section, projects section and contact as well as a blog with that can have posts added, edited or deleted by select users (which need to be specified) with comments on each post that can be added by anyone. (I used a Firebase database so all routing information and permissions would need to be setup by any one wanting to use this.) Authentication set up through Google.
